# Match Free
Match Free is a turn-based puzzle game where you play as a creature trapped in a matching puzzle! Dodge the Puzzler's matches to stay alive and earn mana for powerful abilities. Match Free was created from a challenge to invert the roles of traditional games, and so this reverse puzzle game was born. I developed a typical match-3 architecture with a player controller on top of it. The Puzzler AI features a lookahead brute-force algorithm for challenging single-player gameplay.
