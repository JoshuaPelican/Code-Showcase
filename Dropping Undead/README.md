# Dropping Undead
Dropping Undead is a third-person endless survival game featuring zombies and guns! Blast away unending hordes of increasing zombies with several gun types at your disposal. Dropping Undead is inspired by Call of Duty Zombies gameplay but with a third-person twist. I chose a stylized art direction and sharp color palette to emphasize the core gameplay elements such as health and ammo. The endless round system and limited weapon pickups keep the game interesting over longer play sessions.
