# Trouble In Tornado Town
Trouble in Tornado Town is an physics-based destruction game featuring a giant tornado! Trouble in Tornado Town was produced by a team of 10 college students, outside of class time, to learn how to ship a game. I was the lead programmer and created the wacky gameplay systems that make it so fun to play! I optimized the physics and rendering pipelines to work for the thousands of object we wanted on-screen. It is now fully released on Steam following 2 major post-launch updates.
