# Desert Darts
Desert Darts is an endless arcade game and my first mobile project. Using your phone's gyroscope, control a target with the goal of landing precice hits in rapid succession. Desert Darts features an adaptive difficulty system and complex dart pattern generation for engaging and replayable gameplay, and was created with an accessable, icon-only interface.
